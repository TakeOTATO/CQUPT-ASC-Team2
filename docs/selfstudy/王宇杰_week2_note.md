## Completed tasks
I am responsible for HPCG.With the progress of learning this week,I became familiar with the commands about GitHub,and I'm capable of the basic tasks about Linux and GitHub.Plus,when debugging and processing HPCG benchmark test,I realized how to achieve complex operations with basic Linux commands,and finished several benchmark tests successfully.
## Least familiar parts
What I feel unfamiliar most when using HPCG was to compile configuration files,which requires me to shift myself from **"graphical user interface"** mind to **"command line"** mind when compiling it.
## Problems and confusions
The most challenging part for me was to understand numerous datas in the result file and understand their influences in practical scenes.
