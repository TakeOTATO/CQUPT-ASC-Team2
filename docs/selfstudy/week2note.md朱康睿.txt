Reflection
This week, I found out that my system UOS is not a pure Linux system. During the process of downloading and installing HPL, I discovered that many function libraries are unavailable, such as yum, etc. Then I felt that the process of installing these things was extremely difficult. The tutorials I could find were basically not for the same system. I planned to reinstall the system first and then continue, so I downloaded Ubuntu to try again. However, I couldn't move forward in step three and kept showing the *** error. I searched for thousands of questions for several days but still couldn't solve it.
